### Introduction:

In today's business environment, maintaining a client base becomes one of my key strategic goals. Customer churn is not only a loss of revenue, but also a potential threat to the stability and reputation of my business. Therefore, developing methods to predict and prevent customer churn becomes an important task for me.

With the development of information technology and analytical methods, I have the opportunity to analyze data about my clients - their preferences, behavior and needs. Based on this data, I can build predictive models that will help assess the likelihood of a client leaving and take measures to retain him.

In this work, I will focus on developing a customer churn prediction model for my company. I will use machine learning and data analytics techniques to build a model that can identify customers who are prone to churn and provide me with the tools to respond to this churn in a timely manner.

The purpose of my research is not only to develop a churn prediction model, but also to evaluate its effectiveness and practical applicability in the real conditions of my business. I hope that the results of my work will be helpful to me in managing my customer relationships and increasing customer satisfaction, which in turn contributes to the long-term success and growth of my business.
